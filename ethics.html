        <h1>General IT Ethics</h1>
        <p>Here are some important IT-related guidelines that should be prioritized in the modern day, based on the ACM Code of Ethics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developers should work actively toward the good of society and avoid harm.</li>
            <li>Efforts should be made to minimize harm as much as possible and be transparent and honest with users.</li>
            <li>Privacy must be treated as a top priority. Undermining or profiting from users' private information is considered unethical.</li>
        </ul>
